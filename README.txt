This repository contains all scripts required to reproduce the results and the figures in the publication DOI#. With the exception of the Paraview state files (*.pvsm files), and the two scripts used to create Figures 5 and 6 (Convergence_Comparison.ipynb and additional_tests.ipynb) all scripts should be run self consistently as long as they are run from location that they were placed in this repository.
