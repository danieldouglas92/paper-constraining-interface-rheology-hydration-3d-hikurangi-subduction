Changed: In our plugin systems, we have many factory functions
that create objects and returned raw pointers; in many but not
all places, these returned raw pointers were then converted to
`std::unique_ptr`s. This has been changed now
by (hopefully) consistently letting factory functions
return `std::unique_ptr`s right away, and then dealing with them at
the receiving end.
