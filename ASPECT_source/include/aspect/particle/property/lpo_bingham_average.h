       * Todo: write what this plugin does.
       *
       * A class that integrates the finite strain that a particle has
       * experienced.
       * The implementation of this property is equivalent to the implementation
       * for compositional fields that is described in the cookbook
       * finite_strain <code>cookbooks/finite_strain/finite_strain.cc</code>.
       *
       * The layout of the data vector per partcle is the following (note that for this plugin the following dim's are always 3):
       * 1 averaged a axis of olivine -> 3 (dim) doubles, starts at:
       *                                   data_position + 1,
       * 2 averaged b axis of olivine -> 3 (dim) doubles, starts at:
       *                                   data_position + 4
       * 3 averaged c axis of olivine -> 3 (dim) doubles, starts at:
       *                                   data_position + 7
       * 4 averaged a axis of enstatite -> 3 (dim) doubles, starts at:
       *                                    data_position + 10
       * 5 averaged b axis of enstatite -> 3 (dim) doubles, starts at:
       *                                    data_position + 13
       * 6 averaged c axis of enstatite -> 3 (dim) doubles, starts at:
       *                                    data_position + 16
